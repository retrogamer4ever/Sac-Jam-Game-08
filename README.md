So this was the game I made at the first weekend long game jam event I hosted. It was an interesting ride... The first day I spent building a socket server using node.js in hopes of combining it with Flash to do a multiplayer game... It failed. So around 8am the following day I started working on a new version of the game. You can have acces to the failed code by checking out the zip file I have in everything


THEME
So the theme for this jam was "Survival of the fittest", so I built an area battle game where you had to survive against your foe.

CONTROLS
The game is local two player, the character on the right is up, down, left, right keys will move and fire the character gun. Then the left character is WSAD key's to move around and that will cause him to fire as well. 

OBJECTIVE
objective is to go after each other and see who can fire at each other till person life gives out first. There are also power ups you can pick up.


It turned out pretty good and inspired me to possibly continue developing it.
